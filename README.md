# cnt_jamming
This project explores the jamming behaviour of carbon nanotubes in solution phase, when its concentration is uniformly increased under various initial conditions

The tubes were considered to be sphereocylinders with helical charge distribution.

The jamming was simulated in cubes with periodic boundary conditions.  

The parameters ***pressure, charge per rod*** and ***salt concentration*** were varied so as to study their impact on the jamming densities. The system used for these simulations consisted of **2116 rods**, which was large enough to guarantee that there are enough rods (more than 2) along each dimension of the box, so that the assumed periodicity is valid.

## Observations:
For a given set of parameters, the system was compressed from the isotropic low density phase, until there was no appreciable increase in the density. At this point, the density was noted and plotted.

### Pressure variation:

Five values of pressure were chosen, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500 (mPa) The density curves are plotted below.
